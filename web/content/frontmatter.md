### Making this book

Books contain multitudes. Mattering Press is keen to render the unseen processes of bookmaking more visible. This publishing experiment would not have not  possible without the support of COPIM’s experimental publishing group. We thank our colleagues at the experimental publishing group Janneke Adema, Gary Hall and Rebekka Kiesewetter for developing this book project with us as one of COPIM’s experimental pilot publications. Going forward, we will use this space to thank reviewers, copy editors, and proofreaders.

### Acknowledgments

This book is a truly collaborative exploration of what a datebook could be. It would not have been possible without Simon Bowie and Joana Chicau whose roles oscillated between developer, designer, co-editor, and author. The search interventions, in particular, are, in large part, their achievement. Further, this book would be unthinkable without our collaborations with the composers, actors, researchers, machine operators and designers who developed the Archival Conversations with us; thank you, Rosalind Sinclair, Yemi Awosile, Alice Lemkes, Lee Craigie and Philippa Battye of The Adventure Syndicate and Maciek Tomiczek of Oxford Atelier, Ellen Fowles, Nahuel Cano, Juan Fernández Gebauer, Margo van de Linde and Emma Hoette, it was a joy to enter into archival conversations with you. Finally, this entire project rests on the European Patent Office's exemplary open data policy that allowed us to download and modify the underlying patent database.
