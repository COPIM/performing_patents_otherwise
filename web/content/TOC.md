<h1 class="mt-5"> Table of Content</h1>
<span class="info" style="display: none;">
    <span class="code">↪ This website is the home of “Performing Patterns Otherwise.” It is an archive, a website and an experimental electronic book that binds search, archive and writing in one publication. The landing page navigates the publication according to the conventions of a search engine, foregrounding search. The table of content offers a way of navigating that foregrounds texts, which is more in line with the conventions of book making. The  table of content reveals a logic of zooming in, from the general search to more specific configurations of the relationships between search, content, ordering and sense-making.</span>
